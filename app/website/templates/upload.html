            <li><strong>Incorporate Keywords from the Job Description:</strong> Many employers use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen CVs. Including relevant keywords can help your CV pass through these systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Include a Professional Summary:</strong> Start with a brief summary that encapsulates your qualifications and career goals, providing a snapshot of what you bring to the role.</li>
            <li><strong>Showcase Relevant Skills:</strong> List skills that are pertinent to the job, including both technical and soft skills, to give employers a comprehensive view of your capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Proofread for Errors:</strong> Carefully check your CV for spelling and grammatical mistakes to maintain professionalism and attention to detail.</li>
            <li><strong>Update Your CV Regularly:</strong> Keep your CV current by adding new experiences, skills, and certifications as you acquire them.</li>
